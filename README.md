## ***_Description_***

_There are more than 250 million LPG Gas connections in India. But are we utilizing it efficiently...? Are we aware of the Leakge issues?..It's really difficult to keep a track of the volume of LPG gas Right?? .Especially, those guys who cook a lot have encountered a situation where the LPG gas drains suddenly without even knowing. Also many of us have heard about LPG gas leakages which had lead to a massive explosion. At present technologies are still failing to address these issues.So my team aims at bringing technology to common people. Just think... even though LPG booking apps available , they does not include the subsidy information.The common people will have to step into the bank with the passbook and hence they will be able to know the information of their LPG Subsidy. Now what about the people who cannot afford a smartphone.....? But no worries....  What if the module that we are building takes care of all these things for you?_

_The ACMS helps to monitor the weight, leakage etc.. of the LPG gas cylinder and hence updates the users by giving notification/messages (with the help of IOT technology) regarding the cylinder's health status.The hardware module that we are developing helps to keep a track of the LPG gas usage as well as notifies the user regarding the leakage.We are also adding various security mechanisms to avoid cylinder explosions.The Project that we propose addresses 2 kinds of users.The ones who have an internet connection in their home and others who do not._
_The hardware module that we are designing is common for both the users. The app that we are developing will contain the information regarding various booking agencies and also regarding the cylinder's health status.Subsidy information can be also viewed through the app.Thus the users can book their cylinder through the app.Users can also enable Automatic booking feature in our system.Notifications will be send to those users who have installed this app.The above mentioned features are for those users who have an access to the internet._

_But wait....What about the users who does not have an access to the internet...? The module that we are developing also uses the SMS technology which helps in sending the information regarding the cylinder's weight and Leakage status.We will also provide suitable mechanisms for these users to book their gas cylinder manually. We assure you that our product will be a complete solution for the cylinder monitoring purpose for both the users.Since many of the people and hotels use an LPG gas connection, this product will definitely be a boon for all of them. An all in one solution for your LPG gas needs_
